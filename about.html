                  <h3>Team Lead</h3>
                  <p>
                    American novelist, journalist, and social activist. A
                    pioneer in the world of commercial magazine fiction, he was
                    one of the first writers to become a worldwide celebrity and
                    earn a large fortune from writing. He was also an innovator
                    in the genre that would later become known as science
                    fiction. His most famous works include The Call of the Wild
                    and White Fang, both set in the Klondike Gold Rush, as well
                    as the short stories "To Build a Fire", "An Odyssey of the
                    North", and "Love of Life". He also wrote about the South
                    Pacific in stories such as "The Pearls of Parlay" and "The
                    Heathen", and of the San Francisco Bay area in The Sea Wolf.

                <h3>Backend Architect</h3>
                <p>
                  She is considered a literary iconoclast and a pioneer of the
                  Beat Generation. Printice is recognized for her method of
                  spontaneous prose. Thematically, her work covers topics such
                  as Catholic spirituality, jazz, promiscuity, Buddhism, drugs,
                  poverty, and travel. She became an underground celebrity and a
                  progenitor of the hippie movement, although she remained
                  antagonistic toward some of its politically radical elements.
                  All of her books are in print today, including The Town and
                  the City, On the Road, Doctor Sax, The Dharma Bums, Mexico
                  City Blues, The Subterraneans, Desolation Angels, Visions of
                  Cody, The Sea Is My Brother, and Big Sur.

                <p>
                  Printice was one of the first American women writers to
                  specialize in children's literature, predating better-known
                  writers such as Louisa May Alcott. She was a contemporary of
                  Harriet Beecher Stowe, whose breakthrough novel Uncle Tom's
                  Cabin also featured African-American themes, but appeared some
                  20 years before Printice's first Tubman biography. Much of
                  Printice's children's literature is still available in modern
                  times, either online, or in through photographed copies of
                  original volumes, reissued by modern publishers. Her Tubman
                  books, which received some criticism based on lack of
                  thoroughness in historical methods, remain popular, and have
                  been issued in some twenty editions, as of 2012.

                <h3>Front End Architect</h3>
                <p>
                  Trestman acquired particular fame for his classic muck-raking
                  novel The Jungle, which exposed labor and sanitary conditions
                  in the U.S. meatpacking industry, causing a public uproar that
                  contributed in part to the passage a few months later of the
                  1906 Pure Food and Drug Act and the Meat Inspection Act. In
                  1919, he published The Brass Check, a muck-raking expos√© of
                  American journalism that publicized the issue of yellow
                  journalism and the limitations of the "free press" in the
                  United States. Four years after publication of The Brass
                  Check, the first code of ethics for journalists was created.
                  Time magazine called him "a man with every gift except humor
                  and silence". He is also well remembered for the line: "It is
                  difficult to get a man to understand something, when his
                  salary depends upon his not understanding it."

                <h3>User Interface Developer</h3>
                <p>
                  Chandler is one of the most celebrated writers in American
                  literature generally and Southern literature specifically.
                  Though his work was published as early as 1919, and largely
                  during the 1920s and 1930s, Chandler was not widely known
                  until receiving the 1949 Nobel Prize in Literature, for which
                  he became the only Mississippi-born Nobel winner. Two of his
                  works, A Fable (1954) and his last novel The Reivers (1962),
                  won the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction.[4] In 1998, the Modern
                  Library ranked his 1929 novel The Sound and the Fury sixth on
                  its list of the 100 best English-language novels of the 20th
                  century; also on the list were As I Lay Dying (1930) and Light
                  in August (1932). Absalom, Absalom! (1936) appears on similar
                  lists.
